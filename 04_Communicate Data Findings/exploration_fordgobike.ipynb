    "According to Wikipedia, Ford GoBike is a public bike sharing system in California's San Francisco Bay region. Initially known as Bay Wheels, Ford GoBike is the first regional and large-scale bike-sharing system deployed in California and the west coast of the United States. It was established as bay area bike share in August 2013. As of January 2018, the Bay Wheels system had more than 2,600 bikes at 262 stations in San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, data provided by the bike sharing program during the period of February 2019 will be analyzed. The data will be analyzed through an exploratory analysis and finally an explanatory analysis of the data will be made.\n",

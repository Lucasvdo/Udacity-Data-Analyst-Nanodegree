Although it is evident that there is a difference between the groups and that the control group has a higher probability, we cannot say that one page causes a higher conversion rate than the other. Factors such as aversion to change, resistance to something new and even the attraction to the new, even worse, must be discussed to decide whether or not there was an interference in the results due to these described situations. Finally, in order to support decisions and provide more meaningful information, we need to define a hypothesis test setup and then obtain our p-value to decide if there really is a conversion trend in relation to the pages."

One of the disadvantages of adding additional terms to the regression model is Simpson's paradox in which the combined impact of different variables disappears or reverses when these variables are combined, but appears when these variables are tested individually."

You can use the __File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)__ menu to save your notebook as an .html file. If you are working locally and get an error about \"No module name\", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using `pip install <module_name>` (don't include the \"<\" or \">\" or any words following a period in the module name).\n",

If you made reference to other websites, books, and other resources to help you in solving tasks in the project, make sure that you document them. It is recommended that you either add a \"Resources\" section in a Markdown cell at the end of the Notebook report, or you can include a `readme.txt` file documenting your sources.\n",

You can submit your files as a .zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each project in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.\n",

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com. In the meantime, you should feel free to continue on with your learning journey by beginning the next module in the program."

In this data set, we will analyze the information of 100 thousand medical appointments in Brazil and evaluate the rate of avoidance of consultations. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
<a href="#questions">Questions</a>
Some initial questions were raised, namely:

* Does the SMS service guarantee a lower non-attendance rate?
* Is there a relationship between disease and the no-show rate?
* Is there a relationship between the proportion of no-shows and the neighborhood?
